# BioGraph

There is no fancy name for this library yet, but the ultimate goal is to provide the essential tools required to maximize the amount of information you can extract from your fancy microscopy images.

The library currently works on segmented 3D tissue images and allows the user to extract single-cell information on the cells, and then construct a relational graph linking the different cells detected.
